🎤 How I Made It (For Presentation)

I started with a basic HTML page.

Added React via CDN to manage feedback input and rendering dynamically.

Used TailwindCSS for styling without writing extra CSS.

Wrote a React component (FeedbackApp) that:

Stores feedback in React state (useState).

Updates instantly when a new feedback is submitted.

Tested locally in the browser.

Finally, deployed using GitHub Pages in just a few clicks.

✨ Future Improvements
